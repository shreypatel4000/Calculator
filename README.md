# Calculator
It's my first compound calculator that I made while practicing class-in-class! Hope you like it.
- 1. There are A LOT of files.. non is important if you want the final product, only the MainclassForMultiple.java file is important for 
  the final use.
- 2. The files which are important are marked  with *name.java* DON'T open files with *name.class* in them.
- 3. If you want to see the whole To-And-Fro of the program, you can head to different files for checking it out.
- 4. Please respect the efforts, and don't make any changes to the program if you get to do so.. It took me much effort to do it and I hope
  you'll respect it..
  
- 5. Just one last thing.. don't forget to.. ENJOY!!
